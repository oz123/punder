punder
======

A GTK cd ripper and converter inspired by asunder and written in Python.
The goal of punder is not to be a complete application, rather to be 
a pygtk tutorial and self.learn() mechanism, leading to a functional application.

Most tutorials on GTK, create partial UIs, and thus leave the reader to 
connect the rest by himself. Some others create an almost complete application, 
but usually, this application is useless. 

This tutorial, will lead (eventually, I hope...) to a functional application, 
that rips CD and converts them to MP3 using cdparanoia and lame. In addition
to writing this tutorial in blog posts with code, the code will be highly
verbose and commented thoroughly. 

If you are new to UI programming, I suggest you make yourself very familiar
with Object Oriented programming because PyGTK uses it heavily and at times
the code can grow quite complex and hard to understand. To avoid large files, 
The code is separated into different files holding different classes, which
encapsulates code and hides information. 

A better understand of Object orientation can help understand why this clutter 
is needed and how to cope with it. 

I hope after reading (and writing) this tutorial you (and myself) will 
be able to easily develop applications using PyGTK.

The full tutorial can be found in [1](my blog entries starting with part 1).
